Ford and Ford Credit\u2019s ability to obtain unsecured funding at a reasonable cost is dependent on their credit ratings or their perceived creditworthiness. Further, Ford Credit\u2019s ability to obtain securitized funding under its committed asset-backed liquidity programs and certain other asset-backed securitization transactions is subject to having a sufficient amount of assets eligible for these programs, as well as Ford Credit\u2019s ability to obtain appropriate credit ratings and, for certain committed programs, derivatives to manage the interest rate risk. Over time, and particularly in the event of credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, or other factors, Ford Credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates because of funding constraints. The potential discontinuance of LIBOR is one such risk that could cause market volatility or disruption. In July 2017, the chief executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. It is unknown whether any banks will continue to voluntarily submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 or whether LIBOR will continue to be published by its administrator based on these submissions or on any other basis. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms, or the establishment of alternative reference rates, but the potential discontinuance of LIBOR could adversely affect Ford Credit\u2019s access to the debt, securitization, or derivative markets and its cost of funding and hedging.\u00a0 In addition, Ford Credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates if there is a significant decline in the demand for the types of securities it offers or Ford Credit is unable to obtain derivatives to manage the interest rate risk associated with its securitization transactions.

The regulatory landscape is in flux and can change on short notice. For example, as discussed above under \u201cItem 1. Business - Governmental Standards,\u201d the European Union recently imposed stringent new regulations governing motor vehicle fleet CO2 emissions beginning in 2020, with significant potential penalties for excess emissions. In the United States, legal battles are taking shape over environmental regulatory standards. California, which has an ambitious plan to reduce overall GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, is vigorously opposing an effort by the federal government to preempt state regulations governing motor vehicle GHG emissions. With the backing of other states, California continues to assert its right to promulgate and enforce stringent motor vehicle GHG and ZEV regulations. These conflicts give rise to regulatory uncertainty and create the possibility that applicable regulatory standards may change quickly as a result of court rulings.

For example, in North America, our larger, more profitable vehicles had an average contribution margin that was about 130% of our total average contribution margin across all vehicles, whereas our smaller vehicles had significantly lower contribution margins. In addition, government regulations aimed at reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency (e.g., ZEV mandates and low emission zones) may increase the cost of vehicles by more than the perceived benefit to the consumer. Given the backdrop of excess capacity, these regulations could dampen contribution margins.\n"}, {"Keywords": [], "Entity": [], "Sentiment": "positive", "Topics": ["price movement", "headwinds", "tobacco"], "Sentence_Id": "1981_7_51", "Sentence_Text": "\n"}, {"Keywords": ["trade", "policy", "extent", "governments", "regions", "barriers", "imports", "currency", "policy", "local", "exporters", "global", "marketplace", "significant", "negative", "impact", "manufacturers", "markets", "long", "term", "trend", "growth", "free", "trade", "concern", "recent", "developments", "number", "regions", "imposition", "tariffs", "steel", "aluminum", "united", "states", "direct", "negative", "impact", "costs", "manufacturers", "u.s", "market", "asia", "pacific", "weak", "yen", "cost", "exports", "united", "states", "europe", "global", "markets", "japanese", "manufacturers", "period", "time", "countries", "weak", "currency", "policies", "exchange", "rate", "markets", "likely", "asian", "countries", "south", "korea", "issues", "trade", "policy"], "Entity": ["the United States", "2018", "U.S.", "Asia Pacific", "the United States", "Europe", "Japanese", "Asian", "South Korea"], "Sentiment": "neutral", "Topics": ["guidance", "software", "hardware"], "Sentence_Id": "1981_7_52", "Sentence_Text": "Trade Policy.

In contrast, our Automotive trade payables are based primarily on industry-standard production supplier payment terms generally ranging between 30 days to 45 days. As a result, our cash flow tends to improve as wholesale volumes increase, but can deteriorate when wholesale volumes sharply decrease. These working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow. For example, we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables due to our annual summer and December shutdown periods when production, and therefore inventories and wholesale volumes, are usually at their lowest levels, while payables continue to come due and be paid.
