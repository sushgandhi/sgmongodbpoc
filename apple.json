The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company\u2019s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September\u00a026, 2020 and September\u00a028, 2019, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $3.1 billion and $2.8 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\n"}, {"Keywords": ["apple", "inc", "form"], "Entity": ["Apple Inc."], "Sentiment": "positive", "Topics": ["water", "waste", "supply chain"], "Sentence_Id": "45649879_8_6", "Sentence_Text": "Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 28\n"}, {"Keywords": [], "Entity": [], "Sentiment": "positive", "Topics": ["healthcare", "carbon", "governance"], "Sentence_Id": "45649879_8_7", "Sentence_Text": "\n"}, {"Keywords": [], "Entity": [], "Sentiment": "negative", "Topics": ["waste", "supply chain", "guidance"], "Sentence_Id": "45649879_8_8", "Sentence_Text": "\n"}, {"Keywords": ["september", "september", "company", "outstanding", "floating-", "rate", "notes", "maturities", "aggregate", "carrying", "company", "future", "interest", "rate", "swaps", "interest", "rate", "risk", "outstanding", "term", "debt", "interest", "rate", "swaps", "company", "rate", "payments", "rate", "payments", "rate", "payments", "rate", "payments", "gains", "losses", "term", "debt", "losses", "gains", "related", "hedging", "instrument", "basis", "point", "increase", "market", "interest", "rates", "interest", "expense", "company", "debt", "september", "september", "basis"], "Entity": ["September", "26, 2020", "September", "28, 2019", "Company", "$107.4 billion", "$102.1 billion", "Company", "Company", "100", "Company", "September", "26", "2020", "September", "28, 2019", "$218 million", "$325 million"], "Sentiment": "neutral", "Topics": ["carbon", "governance", "regulation"], "Sentence_Id": "45649879_8_9", "Sentence_Text": "As of September\u00a026, 2020 and September\u00a028, 2019, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $107.4 billion and $102.1 billion, respectively.
